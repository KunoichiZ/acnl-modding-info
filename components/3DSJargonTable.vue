            <td>amiibo</td>
            <td>Series of figures by Nintendo that contain an NFC chip used to communicate with 3DS and WiiU consoles. On the new Nintendo 3DS, the Amiibo can be connected by placing the figure on the bottom screen. For the old 3DS, a separate adapter needs to be bought, as it does not have NFC capabilities.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Boot9Strap (B9S)</td>
            <td>A modified firmware that makes use of sighax and a vulnerability in the console's NDMA engine to gain code execution on the ARM9 BootROM (Boot9) and load a payload ("boot.firm") from the SD card. It uses a modified version the ARM9 payload loader of Luma3DS. The software can also dump the console-specific OTP and BootROMs.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Cartridge (cart)</td>
            <td>A plastic casing containing variable content, for example, a PCB containing a game held on ROM including a backup EEPROM/battery to hold the game save.

            <td>This stands for CTR Importable Archive. It's like a WAD file from the Wii days; it's just a container that contains game files or system firmware updates. Installing these will either install a game (to the SD card) or parts of a system firmware update to your 3DS' NAND (if on emuNAND, then it'll obviously install to the SD card's emuNAND).</td>
