            <td>amiibo</td>
            <td>Series of figures by Nintendo that contain an NFC chip used to communicate with 3DS and WiiU consoles. On the new Nintendo 3DS, the Amiibo can be connected by placing the figure on the bottom screen. For the old 3DS, a separate adapter needs to be bought, as it does not have NFC capabilities.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Boot9Strap (B9S)</td>
            <td>A modified firmware that makes use of sighax and a vulnerability in the console's NDMA engine to gain code execution on the ARM9 BootROM (Boot9) and load a payload ("boot.firm") from the SD card. It uses a modified version the ARM9 payload loader of Luma3DS. The software can also dump the console-specific OTP and BootROMs.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Cartridge (cart)</td>
            <td>A plastic casing containing variable content, for example, a PCB containing a game held on ROM including a backup EEPROM/battery to hold the game save. Here, this term is commonly used to describe a 3DS game card or any other device used to slot into the expansion slots of a handheld, even flash kit adapters.</td>
        <tr>
            <td>CFW</td>
            <td>Short for Custom FirmWare. While this term can be debated until the cows come home, in the 3DS scene, it typically means when you're running NATIVE_FIRM with signatures disabled.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CIA</td>
            <td>This stands for CTR Importable Archive. It's like a WAD file from the Wii days; it's just a container that contains game files or system firmware updates. Installing these will either install a game (to the SD card) or parts of a system firmware update to your 3DS' NAND (if on emuNAND, then it'll obviously install to the SD card's emuNAND).</td>

        <tr>
            <td>eShop</td>
            <td>An online store for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U where digital games, demos, and other things can be downloaded.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>N3DS/New3DS</td>
            <td>"New" 3DS. As in, the model that Nintendo released in late 2014 with Super Stable 3D, the C-stick, and ZL/ZR buttons, and an 804Mhz CPU speed. The New 2DS is the same, except with no 3D features.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>NTR CFW</td>
            <td>Though NTR CFW has "CFW" right in its name, this is NOT what people typically refer to when they talk about CFW. If people ask if you have CFW, NTR is N O T what they're asking about. Usually they're looking for something else like Luma3DS. 
            <br><br>NTR CFW is a CFW that isn't installed like traditional CFW, instead it's launched by programs such as BootNTR or BootNTR Selector. Using NTR, you can do various things, but the primary reason people use it is to load .plg files that can have a variety of applications. These .plg files can be plugins for cheats like the ACNL one this page is for or for additional features such as streaming or an FPS counter in your games. NTR is not permanent. It will disappear as soon as you reboot your 3DS, so the launcher must be used each and every time you plan to use NTR. </td>
