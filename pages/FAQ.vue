      <h1>Animal Crossing: New Leaf NTR Plugin FAQ</h1>
      <p><b>Always make sure to make a backup of your save data!</b> You can use this: <a href="http://bit.ly/B--Save">http://bit.ly/B--Save</a>

      <p><code><b>Why is the home button disabled?</b></code>
      <br><strike>We disabled the home button in 4.0 Beta 2+ since there are memory problems that would cause your 3DS to crash.</strike>
      As of 4.1.1, it is no longer disabled.</p>

      <p><code><b>How do I exit out of the game if the home button is disabled?</b></code>
      <br>You have to power down your 3DS by either pressing and holding the power button or opening the NTR menu by pressing X & Y and choosing the Power option and choosing either power down or restart. On plugin v4.1.1 and later, the home button has been reenabled.</p>


      <p><code><b>Why was the tan modifier removed?</b></code>
      <br>It wasn't, hold "R+X" for about one second and enter the quick menu with additional cheats.</p>


      <p><code><b>Why can I not seed online?</b></code>
      <br>Seeding online could invoke the griefing of other peoples‚Äô towns, and this was not developed to help with that task.</p>
ùÖ≥
      <p><code><b>My game froze while pressing R+X, how do I fix it?</b></code>
      <br>Press "X+Y" and and then exit and it should unfreeze.</p>

      <p><code><b>Pressing select doesn't open the menu, is it glitched?</b></code>
      <br>Make sure no other plugins are in plugin\0004000000086200, plugin\0004000000086400, plugin\0004000000086300.</p>

      <p><code><b>Pressing select still doesn‚Äôt open the menu</b></code>
      <br>Make sure you‚Äôre not using NTR Mode 3. You can find out if you‚Äôre using NTR Mode 3 or not if your version of BootNTR looks like this. If you‚Äôre using NTR Mode 3, you‚Äôll need to reboot your 3DS in order to exit out of Mode 3. Then go to TitleDB on FBI and download ntr with an icon that looks like this: <a href="http://bit.ly/NTR-Icon">http://bit.ly/NTR-Icon</a></p>

      <p><code><b>Collisions are not showing up after placing a building</b></code>
      <br>Save and quit and the collisions should appear.</p>

      <p><code><b>How do I get CFW on my 3DS?</b></code>
      <br>Follow the guide provided at https://3ds.guide/. CFW is not possible on 11.5+ without a third party purchase.</p>

      <p><code><b>XYZ cheat is not working, help!</b></code>
      <br>Please fill out the form using the !form command in #plugin-support. (located in the ACNL Modding Discord Server)</p>

      <p><code><b>How do I use XYZ cheat?</b></code>
      <br>Press on the blue ‚Äúi‚Äù icon on the bottom screen, and a note should pop up with information and instructions on the provided cheat.</p>

      <p><code><b>My Animal Crossing immediately crashes before loading the plugin, is it Luma?</b></code>
      <br>Make sure that you‚Äôre using an up to date version of Luma and NTR selector. Also make sure you‚Äôre choosing NTR v3.3 or higher. Try loading the game without NTR if those don't work. If it doesn't load without NTR, it's most likely the game and not Luma.</p>

      <p><code><b>Animal Crossing hangs on the loading screen and never loads.</b></code>
      <br>First off, not a question. Second, try updating to Luma 8.1 <a href="https://goo.gl/ypmw5g">[https://goo.gl/ypmw5g]>/a> or higher. It is a CTRPF requirement to use Luma 8.1 (as of 4.0 beta 3 of the plugin).</p>

      <p><code><b>What is CTRPF?</b></code>
      <br>It stands for CTR-Plugin-Framework. Citra is the codename of the 3DS, and CTR is short for it (blame Nintendo for making it complicated.) This is the core of the plugin that gives you the nice UI and all these features, and is provided to you by Nanquitas.</p>

      <p><code><b>Where is the source code? (insert Margen67 meme here)</b></code>
      <br>As it‚Äôs a decision of Nanquitas to keep the source closed while CTRPF is in beta, I will respect his decision and keep it closed source until the time comes that he lets us open source. It is a closed beta for developers to develop ‚ÄúCTRPF plugins‚Äù so if you really wanted to develop a plugin, I suggest using BlankCheatMenu <a href="http://bit.ly/blankCHTMenu">http://bit.ly/blankCHTMenu</a> or forking the already open source version of the plugin <a href="http://bit.ly/OS-ACNL-plg">http://bit.ly/OS-ACNL-plg</a></p>

      <p><code><b>I have everything setup correctly, and the plugin still isn't working!</b></code>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you <b>aren't</b> using <u>NTR Mode 3</u>.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have BootNTR Selector's settings set to the default.
        <br>If you do not know what it is set to, hold <b>Select</b> upon booting BootNTR Selector and set it to default.</li>
        <li>Make sure you're using the correct ACNL (see the question above)</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><code><b>My files are in the right place, my BootNTRSelector has the right config, I have the right version of ACNL and the update for that version, NTR loads fine, but not the plugin. What now?</b></code>
      <br><i>As of 3-14-18</i>
      <br>If you've run into this specific situation, ensure that you do not have the Luma fork with plugin loading capabilities. If you have this, update to the latest Luma version at this link:

      <p><code><b>How can I edit my save externally?</b></code>
      <br>None of these will work online, you will need to dump your save with JKSM or some other alternative
      <br><br>
      Here's the online save editor:
      <br><a href="http://www.marcrobledo.com/acnl-editor/">http://www.marcrobledo.com/acnl-editor/</a>

      <br><a href="https://github.com/Mega-Mew/NLSE/releases/latest">https://github.com/Mega-Mew/NLSE/releases/latest</a></p>

      <p><code><b>Can I use a cart or do I have to use a digital version of ACNL to use the plugin?</b></code>
      <br>Any ACNL game (ex. KOR games) will work. That means both a cartridge and a digital game will work with the plugin. Just make sure you have the latest version of your game installed.</p>

      <p><code><b>Can I have item X??</b></code>
      <br>Try asking in #item-request, somebody may be willing to fulfil your request.</p>

      <p><code><b>Can I edit my save without using a computer?</b></code>
      <b>Yes, using a homebrew app that's currently being  developed by <b-tooltip label="Cuyler#0602" dashed>@Cuyler</b-tooltip> and I, though contributions from others are certainly welcome. It is currently a big WIP atm and only has some barebone player editing features. You can find more info about it here: <a href="https://github.com/Slattz/NLTK/">https://github.com/Slattz/NLTK/</a>

      <p><code><b>Can I have permission to post in #mod-showcasing?</b></code>
      <br>Just contact an @Admin, show them what you want to post and they'll decide if you have permission. You'll be given the role @Mod Creator if it's decided you can post in #mod-showcasing.</p>

      <p><code><b>What's #dev-talk for?</b></code>
      <br>This channel is for @Plugin Dev to communicate about development on the ACNL Multi Cheat Plugin. It's viewable to everybody and aims to give insight into the development process of the plugin. 
      Currently only a few people are @Plugin Dev , though this may be changing soon, so stay tuned I guess.</p>

      <p><code><b>I have an idea for the server!</b></code>
      <br>All ideas are welcome and we'd love to hear them! Post them in #general &#128578;</p>

      <p><code><b>What's the difference between WA and Orig in the !workdir and !lumaworkdir commands?</b></code>
      <br>WA stands for Welcome Amiibo being built into the install of ACNL. This version of ACNL has a white background and confetti in the home menu icon. Orig stands for the original version of ACNL, which just has a green background in the home menu icon. These are <b>not</b> interchangeable. WA being built in is different from the Original download and you <b>cannot</b> use the files for one for the other.

      <p><code><b>Which version of NTR do I use?</b></code>
      <br>To save the helpers and us the trouble, here's a direct link to a .cia that will work for this plugin. <a href="https://github.com/Nanquitas/BootNTR/releases/download/v2.12/BootNTRSelector-FONZD-Banner.cia">https://github.com/Nanquitas/BootNTR/releases/download/v2.12/BootNTRSelector-FONZD-Banner.cia</a>
      Install with FBI and load before loading ACNL if using the NTR method for loading plugins.
      This is the version of NTR you use for O3DS, O3DSXL, N3DS, N3DSXL, O2DS, ON4DS, ABC123DS, etc.</p>

      <p><code><b>My text to item isn't working!</b></code>
      <br>Don't use item IDs that start with 00, there will be another one for it further down the page (Use CTRL + F to find it by name)</p>

      <p><code><b>But there's actually no other code further down!</b></code>
      <br>That means you're looking for an item that doesn't go in the inventory (Like the rafflesia)
      Use the RTWE (!rtwe in #bot-commands for instructions) with the codes that start with 00.
      If you want an item that doesn't go into your inventory to be in your inventory, that's seeding and it breaks one of our rules.</p>
